# 🛠️ Course about JavaScript
**[About]:** Repository created to add files/exercises of the course throughout all the journey. 

⚠️ At first I am studying with Roger Melo and eventually taking informations from Maximilian Schwarzmüller's course, other tutor I like to study with.

**Ps:** I used issues to help to note and practice JS
