# 🛠️ Course about JavaScript
**[About]:** Repository created to add files/exercises of the course throughout all the journey. 

⚠️ At first I am studying with Roger Melo and eventually taking informations from Maximilian Schwarzmüller's course, other tutor I like to study with.

**PS:** _I used issues because by this way I can search for topics I need to review when I am coding!_ 😊
